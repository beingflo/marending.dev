		A study of lines
	</Title>
	<P>
		After moving into a bigger apartement, I've found the walls of our office to be a bit naked.
		While I'm a hobby photographer and would like to get more into printing my work, for this space
		I have something else in mind.
	</P>
	<P>
		It started with finding out about <em>generative art</em> via
		<A href="https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza">Tyler Hobbs' Fidenza</A>. I found the look of this
		type of art very appealing. Maybe because I lack creativity, I like the idea of <em>guiding</em>
		randomness towards aestethic order, rather than <em>create</em> from scratch.
	</P>
	<P>
		On this page I want to systematically explore techniques and patterns to generate interesting
		structures. To prevent myself from getting lost in the endless possibilities, I will restrict
		myself to <span class="hover:line-through decoration-1 font-bold">lines</span>.
