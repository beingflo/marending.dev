		<P>
			About 4 years ago I graduated from university and started my first job at a company. Some two
			weeks into my employment I was asked to join a game of foosball (also known as table soccer or <em
				>t√∂ggele</em
			> if you care for some swiss german) by some colleagues. It was fun!
		</P>
		<P>
			Anyway, so my career took off, I enjoyed the craft very much and like to say I contributed one
			or the other valuable thing to the people around me. Today, I can proudly call myself a Senior
			<s>Foosball Player</s>
			<em>*cough*</em> Software Engineer.
