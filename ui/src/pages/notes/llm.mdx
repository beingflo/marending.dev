- Base models don't know about question / answer format, they simply predict the next token
from the context.
- One can fake a conversational agent by constructing a few-shot example prompt that shows the
question / answer format ending in `answer: `. The model will continue in a similar fashion.
- Instruct models are post-trained on human-generated conversations to properly bake in the
concept of answering questions. While the base training might take months, post-training typically
takes only hours.
- Hallucinations are being addressed by first probing a model for what it knows: Paste a paragraph
of wikipedia into one model and have it generate question / answer pairs related to the paragraph.
This is easy because the answers are right there in the context window. Take the generated questions
to another model and have it answer without having the context. Compare answers to determine if second
model knows the answer. If model doesn't know, add an answer to post-training data set to give answer
"Don't know".
- Tool usage works as follows: Model generates special tokens for e.g. web search, inference code
pauses when it encounters those tokens, goes of to do the search, pastes response back into context
and continues inference.
- Interesting insight on reasoning: There is only a fixed amount of computation flowing into any 
given token. So training data needs to be phrased in such a way that the model doesn't have to
solve the entire problem in one token, but instead can spread out intermediary computation on more
tokens. Kind of like slowly reasoning your way towards the solution rather than produce an answer 
immediately and then post-hoc justifying the answer. This leads to the conclusion that LLMs need
token to think. Thinking is intrinsically linked to language processing.
- Many counting and spelling tasks are not working well due to tokens. Tokens only exist for efficiency,
there are efforts to move to character-level or byte-level models. That may solve this problem.
- Post-processing: Reinforcement learning: Model is sampled many times on same question. Answers are
checked for correctness against known answer. Correct answers are trained on to make those token streams
more likely (reinforced). E.g. model has reasoned its way through problem well, not pinning too much computation
on a single token and thus got to the right answer. This is good and should be encouraged through fine-tuning
on those answers.
- Deepseek R1 was the first model where the use of reinforcement learning was publicly talked about.
This model learned to generate thinking sequences, where multiple different approaches are generated
and compared by the model. Only then does it generate a nice output intended for the human with the
previous thinking in context.

- Reinforcement learning in *verifiable domains*: There is a way to reliably tell what the correct
answer is. Trivially or via LLM judge.
- RLHF: Reinforcement learning from human feedback
- Reinforcement learning in *unverifiable domains* (e.g. jokes): Train rewards model few little human
feedbacks, then use that to judge many outputs.
- Discriminator-generator gap: For a human it's way easier to judge output than create output.
- Risk of RLHF: RL may discover a way to game the model as a lossy simulation of a human is judging
output. That may lead to nonsensical output getting high scores. (Adversarial example)
- As a result RLHF is often run briefly to avoid this problem.
- Upcoming capabilities: Multimodal models: Tokenize audio, video and train as usual.
- Upcoming capabilities: Agents: Long, coherent, error-correcting contexts
