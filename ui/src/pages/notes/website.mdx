Some time ago I decided to build a personal website to write about technical things I'm up to. If
you're reading this, surprisingly, I followed through. Now, I'm under no delusion that the things I
have to share will not be world shattering. Instead, I primarily want to write about projects to
motivate myself, force a more rigorous thought process and document stuff for future reference. If
the occasional internet user who happens to find their way to my little corner of the internet
learns something, _anything_, that's just the cherry on top.

I'm generally bad at putting stuff out there due to a case of perfectionism-induced procrastination.
So to counteract this tendency, I'm trying to write notes and publish projects even if they are not
finished yet. The terminology here is deliberate: I'm not calling them posts. _Notes_ describes more
accurately what I'm doing here.

As such, notes on this website should never be considered finished. I will amend them if I see
fit, rephrase if necessary or even delete them if proven not to stand the test of time. They
are also published without to much regard for proof-reading and editing. If you find a typo or
other issue, I'd love to hear about it via the feedback box on the bottom right of every page.
