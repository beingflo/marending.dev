I like to [keep my hosting setup simple](/notes/server-setup/). That includes
not operating a service for secret management on my server. Instead, I've opted
to keep secrets in local `.env` files that are transmitted to the server during
deployment. I also don't run continuous integration pipelines for deployment, but
just issue docker commands via a remote context to the server, which uses SSH for
authentication. Naturally, for maximum comfort I don't have a passphrase on my key. 
This simplicity comes at a security cost that I haven't explicitly thought about
before. But after looking into [passkeys](/notes/passkeys) lately, security has
been more present in my mind, so I'm writing this note to reason my way through
this whole mess.

First, my approach of keeping secrets locally comes with a very practical concern:
it's _very_ easy to accidentally commit `.env` files to the repo, exposing your 
API keys and such to everybody. This risk is quite obvious and, dare I say, not something
I think would happen to me. Regardless, a mechanism where it's so easy to do the 
catastrophically wrong thing is arguably badly designed either way.
But more importantly, I've always considered my laptop, my local files, a sanctuary.
A _server_ hosting services that are exposed to the internet obviously need to be protected
from all the bad actors out there, but my laptop? How could anyone possibly gain access
to it? I could have easily listed a bunch of ways how that could happen _theoretically_,
but I wouldn't seriously have considered that I would have to take precautions against it.
"Times of peace ..." and all that.

A string of supply chain attacks have made me reconsider my stance. Not only do I myself
use a bunch of dependencies on my projects, software I use have a bunch of dependencies.
Did you know that an NPM package can run arbitrary code in lifecycle scripts? I.e. 
any one of your NPM dependencies can declare a `postinstall` script that is run on your
machine after installing the package. Such a script could easily read your `.env` file
or even your `.ssh/id_rsa` key and send it off to wherever! Or maybe it could install
a little hook on your project that will modify the generated code subtly even after
you've removed the dependency. The possibilities are endless. Even if you have _your_
dependencies under control, any piece of software that runs on your system could have
an exploit snuck in via one of _their_ dependencies. Conversely not only does access
to my computer compromise my productive secrets, it also allows an attacker to deploy
malicious software on _my_ behalf. It's kind of depressing to think about. 

After the "Shai-Hulud" compromise, of course the entire industry is trying to find
solutions to this issue. In the meantime, I'm primarily concerned with trying to
avoid having sensitive files lie around on my system. I don't want to give up on
the simplicity of my setup though, I still want to directly deploy software from
my laptop to my server, and I also want to avoid secrets management on my server.
So it's time for one of my signature simple-yet-complicated solutions.

I use 1Password as my password manager of choice. It's solid. Only recently did I
learn that there is a [CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/) as well as
an [SSH agent](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/). I immediately connected
the dots with the conundrum in the back of my head.

Let's consider the SSH key I use to log in to my server first. I created a new key in
1Password, set up the agent, transferred the public key to the server and then deleted
the old key. Now, whenever I want to `ssh` into the server, the ssh client talks to the
ssh agent for authentication with the private key. At that point, 1Password pops up a 
dialog that has me unlock the vault (using password or biometrics). Neat! To my surprise,
this also works flawlessly when I run docker commands towards a remote ssh context.
I did the same for my Github SSH key, as that could also be used to push malicious code
to my projects.

As for my `.env` files, I now started using [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops) with
[age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) to encrypt the files and commit them to their
respective repos.
Here's how this works. First, I generate a new `age` keypair.

```bash
> age-keygen
# created: 2026-01-18T19:10:14+01:00
# public key: age1kasp3na0g9vmp9htuduhn6fdxu2yc7am45lvg48ta97t66nypqys0zvm70
AGE-SECRET-KEY-1KKX7L4J7EXQQJA4K6XCS4SLZANGXEVKAX3H0T2L8Z7QYCUV5T3KQ5LX7TW
```

I store public and private key in 1Password. Then, I create a new `.sops.yaml` file
in the project.

```yaml
creation_rules:
  - path_regex: \.env.*$
    age: "age1kasp3na0g9vmp9htuduhn6fdxu2yc7am45lvg48ta97t66nypqys0zvm70"

```

Now, when you run a SOPS encryption in this project, it will take the configured
public key from this file.

```bash
> sops -e --input-type dotenv --output-type dotenv .env.prod > .env.prod.enc

# .env.prod.enc

The `dotenv` type is so that the resulting file is easier to diff in git. You can try
without it and see the `json` format it defaults to (unless the input filename fits a
pattern, don't ask me). 
As long as the `age` private key is not compromised, this file is now safe to commit to
the repo and the original `.env.prod` file is deleted.

At this point, there is nothing sensitive on disk in plaintext. But how can my deployment
script still see the secrets? This brings us to the 1Password CLI.
