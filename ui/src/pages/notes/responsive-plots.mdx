import { Code } from 'src/components';

I enjoy using [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) for my odd visualization
needs. It has a nice API and looks great out of the box. But for better or worse, Plot does not
automatically use all the space available to render a plot. You need to specify the width and height
of a plot. Doing that manually is a pain, especially once you throw responsiveness into the mix.
You really don't want to just resize the SVG plot to fit the container either, as that undoes a
lot of the nice features of Plot, like automatic axis ticks based on the available space. And don't
even get me started on font size.

All that is to say that I needed to find a way to rerender plots to fit their container. As
I'm building most of my UIs with [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/), neither the JS
framework nor the plotting library are so widely used as to have a solution ready for that
combination. I've had to tinker a bit to find a convenient way to achieve this, learning about
ResizeObserver in the process. Here is the result for posterity:

<Code
value={`import { createSignal, onCleanup, onMount, Show } from 'solid-js';

import * as Plot from '@observablehq/plot';

export type ChartProps = {
  plot: Plot.PlotOptions;
  id: string;
};

export const Chart = (props: ChartProps) => {
  const [width, setWidth] = createSignal(0);
  const [height, setHeight] = createSignal(0);

const onResize = (entries: ResizeObserverEntry[]) => {
setWidth(entries[0].contentRect.width);
setHeight(entries[0].contentRect.height);
};

const observer = new ResizeObserver(onResize);

onMount(() => {
observer.observe(document.getElementById(props.id)!);
});

onCleanup(() => {
observer.disconnect();
});

return (

<div
	id={props.id}
	class="w-full h-80">
	{Plot.plot({ width: width(), height: height(), ...props.plot })}
</div>
);

};`} />
