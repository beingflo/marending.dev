I have recently been on a path towards radical simplification of the systems I build. Forgoing
Spring Boot for a simple Axum Rust backend is a simple choice for me. Choosing a database is
an entirely different story. I have been using PostgreSQL successfully, but operating it has
been a bit of a black box. Sure, I just spin up a standard docker container and it works, but
I wouldn't want to start straying from the default configuration considering the absolute
wealth of features and manual pages there are. So I started looking into SQLite.

## Advantages

SQLite is an embedded database, a library if you will. Compared to dedicated DB servers that
need to be operated separately, this simplifies the deployment significantly. Additionally,
the latency of queries is extremly low, as they are more function call than networked request.
For incremental backups, there is the excellent [Litestream](https://litestream.io/)
project that observes the write-ahead log and pushes changes up to an S3 compatible object storage.
_Right up my alley_.

## Performance

I conducted some microbenchmarks to gauge the performance of SQLite. There is one table that
is declared as follows:

<Code
	value={`CREATE TABLE metrics(bucket TEXT NOT NULL, date TEXT NOT NULL, data TEXT NOT NULL);`}
/>

You might notice that the motivating application to try SQLite is a home-grown metrics
collection system. For one scenario I also add indices on `bucket` and `date`. Next,
I ran a bunch of (hopefully) self explanatory scenarios and measured the execution time of the
queries in isolation. Read queries are prepared statements of the form:

<Code value={`SELECT * FROM metrics WHERE bucket = ?1 AND rowid = ?2;`} />

Notice that `rowid` is an implicit column added by SQLite. Write queries:

<Code value={`INSERT INTO metrics (bucket, date, data) VALUES (?1, ?2, ?3);`} />

The benchmarks were run on my local macbook, as well as a linux ARM server and a linux x86
server on Hetzner.

### Observations

Notice the increase of queries per second across the board once write-ahead log (WAL) mode is
turned on and Synchronization is set to Normal. The 90th percentile duration column is
indicated in microseconds! Even the slow queries are still incredibly fast. The most
"real-world" scenario here is probably `WAL + Index (mixed, 80% read)`. We are looking at
a QPS in the ballpark of `100'000` regardless of platform. Plenty fast for my usecases.

## Limitations

I found it hard to get any speedup when trying to access a single SQLite DB from multiple
threads. Writes are single threaded by nature, not much of a debate there, but reads (at least
in WAL mode) should scale well. It's probably down to the library I use for connection
pooling. But considering single threaded performance is already so good, I didn't spend to
much time here. In Rust lingo, I just use an `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>` to protect
a single connection from concurrent access.
