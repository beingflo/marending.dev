[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) has been my go to hosting provider for some
time, thanks to their reliability and low cost. Some months ago they started offering
Ampere-based ARM servers on their VPSs. They offer more cores and more RAM for the same money.
It sounds very appealing to me to move away from x86 entirely, since my development machine is
also ARM based (Macbook M1). But before I migrate my setup to ARM servers I wanted to run some
basic benchmarks to see what I'm getting myself into.

## Results

<CPUResults />
<MemoryResults />
<FileIOResults />

Results are mixed but it seems like especially for compute heavy applications the
price-to-performance is way better with the ARM servers.

## Methodology

The plots show the results of these sysbench invocations:

```
sysbench cpu --threads=x run"
sysbench memory --threads=x run"
sysbench fileio --threads=x --file-test-mode=seqwr run"
```

The instances under test are the CPX31 for x86 and the CAX31 for ARM. They have 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM and
8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM respectively.
