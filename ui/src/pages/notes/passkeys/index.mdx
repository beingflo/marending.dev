I've been meaning to look into passkeys for a while now. I always enjoy being
informed on new developments in the industry, but for some reason this particular
technology has been eluding me. A couple of misconceptions combined with entirely
too much misinformation on the internet made passkeys unapproachable for me.
Finally, I want to dive deep, properly understand them, and start using them.
Luckily, I already have two [Yubikeys](https://www.yubico.com/ch/product/yubikey-5-series/yubikey-5c-nfc/)
lying about that I bought years ago for hardware-based OTP but never ended up using.
They support the standards in question, so they will come in handy when playing around with
passkeys.

## What are passkeys

First, it's important to establish a broad view of passkeys and their underlying standards.
In practical terms, passkeys are cryptographic key pairs that are generated and handled by
*authenticators*. These can be hardware-based like security keys or software-based like platform
keychains or password managers. The [WebAuthn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API)
web standard specifies how websites interact with the browser to register new passkeys
and authenticate with existing passkeys. How the browser then talks to authenticators is
captured in the Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). Together, WebAuthn and CTAP
make up the broader [FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) standard.

## Registration and authentication flows

Let's now have a simplified look at how clients, browsers and authenticators interact.
First, the registration flow to establish new credentials:

![registration flow](./_register.svg)

Following this, existing credentials are used to authenticate:

![authentication flow](./_authenticate.svg)

## Authenticators

Authenticators are worth having a closer look at, as they play a central role in passkey handling.
They are commonly separated into platform and cross-platform (or roaming).
Platform authenticators come built into your device, like Apple Face ID or Windows Hello.
Cross-platform authenticators are portable. For instance, security keys or password managers
are cross-platform, as they can be used from multiple devices. Smartphones can simultaneously
be platform authenticators when signing in *on device* or roaming authenticators when used
to sign in *on another device*.

The FIDO2 standard requires authenticators to at least support testing for *user presence*.
A security key for instance will require the user to touch a capacitive button before a
challenge is signed. The Apple Face ID authenticator will additionally support
*user verification* via biometrics or PIN.

Notice that how key pairs are stored is not part of the specification. Some authenticators, like
security keys, will generate a key pair and never hand out a private key. This means the key
is tied to the physical possession of the device. Password managers on the other hand will offer
to sync passkeys between your devices. This added comfort comes at the cost of having to trust
your password manager to keep your keys safe in transit.

## Advantages of passkeys

The security industry has learned from the way traditional passwords have
been exploited and has thus built a bunch of improvements into the standards behind
passkeys:

- They are generated by the authenticator, not the user. This makes it impossible to
accidentally generate weak passkeys, as is commonly done with passwords. As a result,
passkeys are also automatically unique, as the user has no chance to reuse one.
- The key to prove your identity and the key to check your proof are not the same.
This means that the server does not need to protect a shared secret. If a site is breached,
nothing of value about your ability to authenticate can be stolen. Passwords on the
other hand are a shared secret between user and server, so the server must take great
care to handle them responsibly.
- They offer protection against phishing. Passkeys are bound to an origin, that means
an attacker cloning a website cannot coax your authenticator into signing a challenge.
Users with passwords on the other hand readily type them into a fake site that looks real.
- They are easy to use. While most of us use password managers, the process of auto-filling
username and password fields is error-prone, as it relies on parsing the web page for fields
with appropriate attributes. Many sites do this wrong, leading to having to copy and paste
passwords. Passkeys on the other hand build on proper programmatic APIs that can be easily
implemented to specification by website, browser and authenticator. This should make the
process seamless and robust.

## Misconceptions

With the basics out of the way, let's look at some common misconceptions to clarify our
understanding.

### If you lose the device with the passkey, you're locked out

When I first learned about passkeys and wanted to try them, they were often used synonymously
with security keys. So my biggest misunderstanding that prevented me from adopting passkeys was
the belief that if I lose my Yubikey, I'm going to be locked out of my accounts. The common advice
at that time was to get a *second* Yubikey and register a passkey on each device for every
account. Then, deposit one security key in a safe spot so that if you lose the one that you have
with you, there is a fallback.

This misses two crucial pieces of information. First, passkeys simply replace passwords, they don't
claim much more than that. So what do you do if you misplace your password? You enter a "Forgot
my password" flow on the auth page of a service. Turns out you can do exactly the same if you
lost your passkey. Most services will allow you to register a new passkey this way if you can
prove your identity, usually by accessing your email account. Second, services typically don't
disable other authentication methods just because you registered a passkey. In the case of
Github, for instance, you have the option to sign in via passkey or via username / password + two
factor authentication.

Naturally, this has security implications. Your shiny new passkey is only as secure as your
email account or your alternative authentication methods. For this reason, some services
will allow you to disable other authentication modes and fallback mechanisms.
Then, and only then, does the original fear of getting locked out materialize. You better keep
those passkeys safe in this case.

Finally, most people are going to be saving their passkeys in synchronizing authenticators, like
platform keychains or password managers. For these, losing a device doesn't matter much anyway as
long as you have a way to get back into the authenticator.

### Passkeys don't replace 2FA

This is quite a contentious take that illustrates how poor the general understanding of security
is around the internet. You'll read many misguided arguments that don't hold up to scrutiny.
After some research, it seems a reasonable argument goes as follows: If the authenticator employs
*user verification* during authentication, passkeys do indeed provide similar security guarantees
as passwords with a second factor. Access to the authenticator is something *you have*, and the
biometrics or password you use to unlock your authenticator are something *you are or know*.
Thus, you have two factors. Now, if your authenticator is *not* verifying you during authentication,
but only tests for your presence (as the standard requires), you only have one factor: the physical
possession of the authenticator. An example of such an authenticator is a security key that is
not configured with a PIN and hands out signatures at the touch of a button.

Now, this line of reasoning feels suspect to me. By this logic, my use of strong passwords stored in a
password manager would also qualify as two factors: access to the authenticator and biometrics to unlock.
I suppose the big difference is that for passwords, a service cannot assume that they are handled
correctly—strong, unique, and stored in a password manager—whereas passkeys are guaranteed to have these
properties. Another iffy aspect of the argument is what happens when your password manager is
breached. In that scenario, you're immediately compromised. A password in a password manager and an
OTP code provided by an authenticator app on your phone would save you from this.

So counting factors is not all that matters here. Separate password storage and OTP generation
give you two *trust anchors*, versus just the one with passkeys. Instead, we have to consider that
2FA methods were conceived to reduce a user's attack surface by making passwords no longer sufficient to
authenticate alone. This way, attackers who gain access to passwords via phishing, database breaches, etc.
can't log in without also tricking you into providing the second factor. From this perspective, it's clear
why services like Github consider passkeys sufficiently strong to replace password + 2FA: they
reduce this attack surface by binding keys to origins and eliminating shared secrets.

Also note that passkeys can be used as the second factor to strengthen passwords.

## How do I use passkeys now?

Now that a decent understanding of passkeys has been established, what do I do with this information?
First, let me elaborate on where I'm coming from. I was always very lazy when it comes to 2FA; to
this date, I have 2FA enabled only on the services that force me to use it. As someone who
considers himself a well-informed power user, this is a point of shame for me (hence I'm writing
this note finally). However, after the above revelation that properly managed passwords
are actually not *that* much worse than passkeys, it would be easy to feel validated and
continue to do business as usual.

Instead, now that the uncertainty of how this technology works exactly is gone, I can focus on
the ease of use of passkeys. Especially *discoverable credentials* (passkeys that contain
metadata about the user) are just magical: You navigate to a login page, get a popup from your
authenticator, put your finger on the fingerprint sensor, click on "Sign in", and that's it.
No entering usernames, no scrambling to get your phone for the OTP code. That ease of use,
coupled with the improved security, actually makes it a no-brainer to use passkeys.

But which authenticator to use? For me, built-in platform authenticators are not an option due
to vendor lock-in. There *is* a draft specification now that will allow exchanging credentials
between authenticators, but I'd rather use an authenticator that is portable from the get-go.

Further, there is also the opposite problem of vendor "lock-out": Apple may ban your Apple ID
just for [buying a couple of gift cards](https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/), and Google may ban
your entire account for buying Youtube Premium via a VPN in Turkey. This is also the reason
I don't use Gmail anymore, I would be putting too many of my digital eggs into one basket.
An independent authenticator sounds more reasonable to me.

So password managers and security keys are still in the race.
Password managers boast the following advantages:

- Convenience & usability. They are easy to access via biometrics or password and are available on all
devices.
- Easy recovery. They synchronize passkeys across devices and into the cloud, ensuring they aren't
lost when a device breaks.

Security keys, on the other hand, have one main strength: security. Passkeys on a Yubikey are
hardware-bound. No breach of any online service is going to compromise credentials.

### Threat model considerations

The more I think about this, the more I realize that (apart from getting phished, of course) I
worry more about getting locked out of accounts than about trusting nobody.
I *could* only use security keys and eliminate trust in a password manager, but I believe
the chances that I lose two security keys are higher than 1Password getting compromised.

Ultimately, I think hardware-based security is not worth the effort for me. The usability of
password managers wins out for my use cases. But security keys can still have their place
in my security theater. Not as exclusive auth methods, but as additional ones.

For critical services I really don't want to lose access to, like email, password manager,
and domain registrar, I'm going to register additional passkeys on both of my security keys.
This way, I always have backup access if I lose access to my primary passkey. This could
also serve as a nice way into my accounts for a spouse should something happen to me.
Does this increase my overall attack surface? Probably. An attacker can now choose between
hacking my password manager *or* breaking into my place, stealing my Yubikey, and somehow
getting their hands on the PIN—whichever is easier. But again, I consider getting locked
out more likely than someone targeting me to this degree. And if they do, the good old
wrench method is anyway the most effective.

For the accounts that don't support passkeys, I'll now enable 2FA with a TOTP authenticator
on my phone everywhere. Why not use the password manager's TOTP functionality and do away
with the phone altogether? Honestly, I'm not sure. I suppose when I trust the password manager
not to be compromised, there is little benefit in having a second device.

### Passkeys in the wild

First impressions of using passkeys with a password manager are good. It's fast and smooth.
The first problem arises when wanting to use a security key: first, one must dismiss the
password manager prompt, then, when the native prompt presents itself with Apple's keychain
front and center, one must click on a small "Other options" button, and only then is there
the option to use security keys.

Next, let's have a look at specific services around the internet.

#### Github

When registering secondary passkeys on security keys, I have to set up a PIN. It looks like
Github requires user verification, so just touching the capacitive button on the Yubikey is not
sufficient, unlike with the other services below.
The usability when logging in is kind of weird. When I already entered the PIN before, I can just
touch the button on the login page and I'm in. However, when I've newly plugged the key in,
touching the button doesn't do anything; instead, I have to dismiss the password manager prompt,
select security key, and then I'm prompted for the PIN and can log in.
And now that I've set PINs on my keys for Github, I have to enter them for other accounts as well.
I suppose most services set user verification to `preferred`, which doesn't require it, but now
that it's set, I will get prompted.

#### Porkbun

Once a passkey is registered, password login doesn't work anymore. Unfortunately, there is no option
to influence this behavior, and it's also not mentioned anywhere.
Porkbun also offers the option to force user verification on the passkey.

#### Fastmail

Nothing special here, other than the fact that there is no direct way to add an arbitrary passkey.
Instead, there are "on this device" and "on another device" options. Only with the latter does
one get the option to use security keys.

#### Hetzner

Doesn't support WebAuthn, only 2FA using OTP via mobile device or Yubikey.

#### Exoscale

This is an S3 object storage provider I use for backups. It doesn't support passkeys and
does support OTP via a mobile app, though it requires a phone number to serve as a backup
second factor via SMS. Kind of disappointing for developer tooling. It's widely known at
this point how insecure SMS-based 2FA is. And if it's required as a backup, well, the
whole chain is only as strong as the weakest link.

#### 1Password

Added OTP for password login and passkeys on both security keys as second factors.
1Password doesn't seem to offer registering passkeys as the only authentication mechanism,
only as second factors. Weirdly, even if I sign out everywhere, 1Password never asks for
any second factors. Apparently, this is only required on new devices.

#### Google

This is the first service where I get a popup from Firefox warning me that the website is
requesting extended information about my security key. Apparently, this exposes device
identifiers of the security key to enable security-critical websites to disallow
insecure or compromised keys. A (surely only accidentally useful for Google) side
effect is that your keys could be tracked across multiple websites this way.

## Closing thoughts

I'm glad I finally looked into passkeys. Not only are they convenient as a user, but I'm inclined
to also look into WebAuthn as the sole authentication method for future side projects. To this end,
I'll probably write up a proof-of-concept implementation in a future note.

This was also helpful to finally get my security hygiene in order. I'd say I'm now in a fairly
good spot: every account of value has at least 2FA enabled. While I'm at it, I'll also look into
putting my SSH keys into 1Password or a security key to avoid having them lying around on my
system.

As the resident tech person in my circle, I'll recommend people start adopting passkeys using
a password manager going forward.
