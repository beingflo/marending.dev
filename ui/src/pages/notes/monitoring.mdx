I'm hosting a bunch of software on a VPS. Among them a todo list, a note-taking application,
and of course my personal website. It would be a hassle if that were to go down without me noticing
for an extended period of time. Especially my notes app contains information that I sometimes 
urgently need access to. Naturally, I want to know sooner rather than later if my server or individual
deployments go down. For this reason, I was looking around for uptime monitoring tools some time ago.

Now, 2 years of using [updown.io](https://updown.io) later, I want to highlight this neat little service. I wish more software
was built like it.

## Feature set

updown effectively comes with two features:
- uptime monitoring
- pulse monitoring

Uptime monitoring is the core feature you expect from any monitoring service. It hits your website/webapp
with a request regularly, checking the response status, response time, SSL certificate expiration, etc.
in the process.

Pulse monitoring works the other way around. You're expected to hit an endpoint at updown regularly to 
indicate that you're alive and well. This is very useful to me to ensure backups are running: I have 
backup scripts that upload DB dumps to S3 and send a pulse to updown upon successful completion. If that
script stops working for some reason (e.g., expired S3 credentials), the monitor would alert me.

And then there is some other stuff you would expect but I don't use: status pages, API access, etc.
That's pretty much it. No automated browser tests, no integrated tracing, no bells and whistles. 
Just the rock-solid essentials.

And I've noticed that this kind of minimalism encourages more home-grown solutions. Say I not only
want to check that a service is up, but also that the API is working correctly. Some monitoring services
offer automated API testing for this purpose. To achieve this with updown, I would instead deploy a
container that regularly runs these tests and reports success via a pulse check.

The hard thing you don't want to do yourself is the alerting, that's the part that requires independent
hardware that won't go down along with your infrastructure. That's the part updown takes over. The rest—
the testing framework I use, how I run them, etc.—I don't want to marry to a monitoring solution. Some
platform may offer a way to write API tests in JS, but I may prefer [hurl](https://hurl.dev).
The fact that I'm left to construct my own solution around the essentials is getting more 
attractive the more experience I gain.

Of course, one should always carefully consider the maintenance burden of building your own solution.
But the cost of the hosted, locked-in solution is often underestimated. And I'm not just talking 
about monetary cost.

## Pricing
Right in line with the philosophy behind this service, the pricing is extremely reasonable. You buy
credits upfront, and then your checks consume the credits. For my modest usage, that comes out to 
less than 50 cents per month. How *refreshing*.

I often feel annoyed with the pricing services go with: a free tier that has limited functionality, 
followed by a paid tier that goes well beyond my usage but costs, say, 15 bucks a month.
I *want* to give them money; I want them to have a stable, sustainable business. But I also want
to pay a fair amount based on my usage. It doesn't make sense that I pay the same amount of money
whether I check 1 website once an hour or 10 websites every minute. There needs to be some gradation.

Anyhow, I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir. I also understand the business's perspective, subscription 
models make way more money, and small fish customers are probably just not worth the support obligation.
All the more reason to celebrate the businesses that do offer such friendly pricing.
