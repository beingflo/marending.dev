Let me take you back to around 6 years ago. I was starting to 
[de-Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle) my life, replacing Google Drive 
and Google Photos with [pCloud](https://www.pcloud.com/). Now, while pCloud is fine as a
cloud storage provider, it really didn't nail the photo aspect of it. At that time,
viewing images was painfully slow, as in, taking 10 seconds for any thumbnail to load in.
It felt as if they were regenerating thumbnails on every view.

This made me wonder if hosting and efficiently serving images was really that hard, 
or if pCloud simply didn't care about the user experience. Google was pulling it off, 
but maybe that was a result of hundreds of engineers and specialized compression schemes.

So I set out on my first ever attempt at a side project (apart from some smaller CLI tools
and such) with _[foti](https://github.com/beingflo/foti/tree/master)_. This is code I wrote
with around 1 month of on-the-job frontend experience. View it at your own risk. I was using
a python server that eagerly downsampled images for thumbnails and served them up via a 
web socket connection (for whatever reason). The whole thing was running on a Raspberry Pi 4
in a box in my cupboard.

While the result wasn't pretty, it served to validate my suspicion: Serving images at anything
faster than a glacial pace _wasn't that hard_.
