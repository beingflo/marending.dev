Let me take you back to around 6 years ago. I was starting to 
[de-Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle) my life, replacing Google Drive 
and Google Photos with [pCloud](https://www.pcloud.com/). Now, while pCloud is fine as a
cloud storage provider, it really didn't nail the photo aspect of it. At that time,
viewing images was painfully slow, as in, taking 10 seconds for any thumbnail to load in.
It felt as if they were regenerating thumbnails on every view.

This made me wonder if hosting and efficiently serving images was really that hard, 
or if pCloud simply didn't care about the user experience. Google was pulling it off, 
but maybe that was a result of hundreds of engineers and specialized compression schemes.

So I set out on my first ever attempt at a side project (apart from some smaller CLI tools
and such) with _[foti](https://github.com/beingflo/foti/tree/master)_. This is code I wrote
with around 1 month of on-the-job frontend experience. View it at your own risk. I was using
a python server that eagerly downsampled images for thumbnails and served them up via a 
web socket connection (for whatever reason). The whole thing was running on a Raspberry Pi 4
in a box in my cupboard.

While the result wasn't pretty, it served to validate my suspicion: Serving images at anything
faster than a glacial pace _wasn't that hard_. With a proof-of-concept in the bag and my appetite
for side projects awakened, I decided to first hone my web dev skills on an "easier" target: 
note taking. In my mind, I would quickly build a note-taking application to satisfy a personal
need, learning a ton in the process, and then swiftly return to my actual goal - the image gallery.

If you've read about [fieldnotes](/notes/fieldnotes), you'll know that this was more than a short
intermezzo. I lost myself there for a couple of years, then a bunch of other [projects](/projects) 
snuck in and here we are, quite a while later. Once I finally got back to it, I started sketching
out the feature set and architecture, only to be distracted again by another project. In the second
round of getting back to it, I drastically cut down the scope and finally pushed it over the line.
This is the version I'm writing about now. As always, there are a bunch of learnings here. Reflecting
on those is the main reason I write these project reports.

## Features

[Reflective](https://github.com/beingflo/reflective) is currently a simple gallery for
distraction-free viewing of my images. The main view one is greeted with when opening the web app
is a grid of all the images ingested into the system:

No buttons or labels around to distract from the images. When scrolling, the application seamlessly loads
in more images. All images are cropped to a 4:3 landscape aspect ratio.

There is no categorization into albums or folders, it's a simple feed of images in reverse chronological order.

Images can have an arbitrary number of tags associated with them. When looking for specific images, once can
open the search bar via shortcut (`cmd+k`) and search for any tag. In the following screenshot, the images are
filtered down to ones with a filter titled `japan`. There are 1860 images matching that query.

To tag images, one can open the tag view (`cmd+e`) and select individual images, or all the images between two
selections by holding down `Shift`. The tag bar now shows tags that all selected images have in common, ones that
only some images have (in lighter gray), as well as an input field to add new tags to all selected images.

Back in normal view mode, one can open an image in fullscreen view by clicking on it. A lightbox now fills 
the screen, there are shortcuts to switch to the previous and next image as well as loading in a full-resolution
version of the image to zoom in for details.

Further, hitting `cmd+i` displays some selected metadata of the image file below the image.

To ingest images into reflective, I copy files into a folder on my server and create a marker file in a 
certain location. The server will now recognize that there are new files and will start downsampling the
new images for thumbnails. Once that process is complete, the new images will appear in the view.
