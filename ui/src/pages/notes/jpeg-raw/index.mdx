I've been taking pictures on vacation, around the house and out and about with friends for a 
couple of years now as a way to document life. But after all this time, I'm still
not happy with my photo workflow. In a departure from my usual technical musings, in this
note I'm exploring one of age old questions the old philosophers already asked.

> Should I shoot JPEG or RAW on this thing?
> - Plato

This is one of those notes where I'm mostly trying to pelt my thoughts into some cohesive form.
There may or may not be anything to see here for you.

## Some background on (Fujifilm) image formats

I shoot with a Fujifilm X100F. Fuji cameras come with so-called _film simulations_, a fancy way to say
you can tweak the JPEG output of your camera. Every other camera manufacturer offers the same, but some
say Fujis JPEGs are nicer. I can only compare to Olympus JPEGs, where every single profile other than
the standard one _does_ look terrible. Either way, for me that means that no matter how long I stare
at an image in an image editor, I can never get it to look as nice as a Fuji JPEG in the
Classic Chrome look ðŸ‘Œ.

These film simulations are so infamous at this point that there are [entire websites](https://fujixweekly.com/2017/08/27/my-fujifilm-x100f-classic-chrome-film-simulation-recipe/) 
dedicated to curating Fuji _recipes_, which include the simulation itself as well as other parameters 
that can be tweaked.

Now, when I shoot JPEGs I'm getting these nice colors out of the box. But those very colors (or that 
lack thereof in case of a B&W recipe) are backed into the file. It's hard to recover from that.
If I crushed those shadows as a stylistic choice in camera, I'm not getting them back.
That's what RAWs are for: These files are more or less raw sensor readings from the camera. Maximally
flexible, maximally boring and flat without any editing applied. Here are some axioms about these
files:

- You can always recreate JPEGs from RAW
- You can never recreate RAWs from JPEGs, or even, say, color JPEGs from B&W JPEGs

It's a one-way street. As for the first point, you can even get those authentic Fuji JPEGs thanks to
[X Raw Studio](https://www.fujifilm-x.com/de-ch/products/software/x-raw-studio/). This piece of software
allows you to send RAW files through your physical cameras JPEG engine to get the
very same result as if you had shot JPEG in the first place.

Alternatively of course, you can wrangle RAWs into any grid of pixels physically possible (including
those magical Fuji pixels) via a RAW editor. From this property, the age-old wisdom originates: Beginners shoot JPEG because they don't any better,
everyone else shoots RAW.

## Where am I coming from?

I currently shoot RAW+JPEG because I like the JPEG colors, but I also like the flexibility and 
freedom to stop liking them in the future. But that's where the trouble starts. Now I have cull 
those image. How do you look through images on your disk that occur in pairs and delete the bad 
ones? You can use specialized software that understands that `DSCXXX.jpeg` and `DSCXXX.raf` are 
the same image and should be treated as such: Deletion of the image should remove both files. 
On macOS, such software is surprisingly elusive and / or expensive. So, as you do, you write a script for it.

```bash
mkdir ./trash
for file in ./raw/*; do
  [[ $file = *.JPG ]] && continue  # skip .JPG files
  jpg_file=$(basename ${file%.*}.JPG)
  [[ -s ./jpeg/$jpg_file ]] || mv "$file" ./trash
done
```

Here's how this works: When I plug the SD card from my camera into my computer, I get a folder with
images, each a `.jpeg` and a `.raf` version. I then copy the JPEG files into a `jpeg` folder and the
RAW files into a `raw` folder. Then I cull the JPEGs with Preview. Once done, I run the above script,
which moves all the RAW files into the trash folder, that don't have a corresponding JPEG image.

This makes the culling process bearable. But now what? I enjoy the JPEGs coming out of my
camera (I spent considerable amount of time researching recipes, they better) so 
I don't need to do any heavy color correcting or such. But I still need to make the occasional
exposure adjustment, leveling or crop. So, after months of deliberation, I purchased a license for
[Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/en) for an eye-watering 300 bucks a while back.
I import the JPEGs into CO and do my light adjustments, then I export them at some arbitrary resolution
and quality setting. That's it, those are my images now that I occasionally look at.

I've started printing my images as well, lately. For this, I also take the original JPEGs and edit them to get them
to look the way I want out of the printer (the damn thing always skews magenta).

Oh the RAW files, what happened to them? Well they get chucked in a backup somewhere, in case I need
them in the future. I rarely do, but you never know. In an unrelated thought the term 'data hoarder' comes to mind.

This workflow is somewhat convoluted, that's why I'm reevaluating it. I don't like that I have to
juggle two file types. I don't like the indecisiveness of wanting to make decisions in-camera, but then
keep a backup just in case. I also don't like that with my (non-destructive) edits on the JPEGs in 
Capture One, the "source of truth" is in a proprietary database file of this editor and _not_ some standard
image files.

<Hint>
  Now this right here is the reason I'm writing notes like this. Only when trying to verbalize the reasons
  I dislike my workflow did this fugitive thought crystallize. Writing is thinking and all that jazz.
</Hint>

I do have a perpetual license, but it still doesn't sit right with me.

## What _do_ I like?

Philosophically

1. I want to choose settings in camera
2. I want a simple shooting experience (OVF)
3. I want to edit as little as possible

1. Simple. I want to spend my time taking pictures, not editing, culling and otherwise managing photos etc.
2. Flexible. I want to be able to change my mind later.

## What are my options?

- Shoot JPEG only
- Shoot RAW only
- Shoot RAW+JPEG

Thus, I can not shoot JPEG only. It fulfills the first criteria, but fails the second.
I can not shoot JPEG + RAW, because it fails the first criteria.
Shooting RAW only seems to be the only way.

Now there are two options
