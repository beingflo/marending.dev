I've been wanting to start using passkeys for a while now. I even bought two
[Yubikeys](https://www.yubico.com/products/) 5 (!) years ago and have been
carrying one of them on my keychain ever since with the intention of putting
them in operation any day now. Alas, it hasn't happened yet. I blame it partly
on the terrible marketing surrounding them and partly on my laziness. So now,
I finally want to dive deep, properly understand and start using them.

## What are passkeys
First, we need to properly understand what we're even talking about. Passkeys are
commonly defined as 
[WebAuthn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) 
credentials. The Web Authentication API is a W3C standard to enable authentication
with public key cryptography. It fits into the broader 
[FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) standard, along with the Client to 
Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). All this is to say is that if you want to use 
passkeys in a web application, the application is asking the browser to authenticate
with passkeys via WebAuthn and the browser is then talking to authenticators (like 
a Yubikey or a password manager) via CTAP.

So, passkeys are simply a key pair stored in an authenticator.

## Advantage of passkeys
The security industry has learned from the way traditional passwords have
been exploited have thus built a bunch of improvements into the standards behind
passkeys:

- They are generated by the authenticator, not the user. This makes it impossible to
accidentally generate weak passkeys, like it is commonly done with passwords.
- The key to prove your identity and the key to check your proof are not the same. 
This means that the server does not need to store your secret in a secure way, instead,
it can hold onto your public key carelessly. If a site is breached, nothing of value about
your ability to authenticate can be stolen. Passwords on the other hand are a shared
secret between user and server, so the server must take great care to handle it responsibly.
- They offer protection against phishing. Passkeys are bound to an origin, that means
an attacker cloning a website can not coax your authenticator into signing a challenge.
Users with passwords on the other hand readily type them into a fake site that looks real.
