In [a previous note](/notes/co2-bedroom) I explored how closing the bedroom door affects
CO2 levels during sleep. Since then, we've moved into a new place that is effectively one big open
space. The total air volume is probably slightly smaller.

As I just set up my CO2 sensor again (after having it lie around in a box for a couple of
months), I couldn't help but try reproducing the experiment. This time, by nature of the
living space, there is no door to open or close.

<div class="my-4">
	<Chart
		options={{
			y: { label: 'â†‘ co2 (ppm)', domain: [400, 1400] },
			x: { type: 'time' },
			marginLeft: 60,
			marks: [
				Plot.lineY(
					data?.map(({ date, value }) => ({
						date: new Date(date),
						value,
					})),
					{ x: 'date', y: 'value' }
				),
				Plot.ruleY([1000], { stroke: 'orange', strokeDasharray: 2 }),
			],
		}}
	/>
</div>

You can observe that the CO2 level develops somewhere in between the closed and the open door
scenario from the last apartment: Not nearly as bad as the 3500ppm with the door closed, but
also not as good as the flat 800ppm with the door open.

Apart from the smaller volume for the CO2 to disperse into, I also blame the new apartment
being more modern and thus probably more air-tight than the last one.
