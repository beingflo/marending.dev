			In <A href="/notes/co2-bedroom">a previous note</A> I explored how closing the bedroom door affects
			CO2 levels during sleep. Since then, we've moved into a new place that is effectively one big open
			space. The total air volume is probably slightly smaller.
		</P>
		<P>
			As I just set up my CO2 sensor again (after having it lie around in a box for a couple of
			months), I couldn't help but try reproducing the experiment. This time, by nature of the
			living space, there is no door to open or close.

		<div class="my-4">
			<Chart
				options={{
					y: { label: 'â†‘ co2 (ppm)', domain: [400, 1400] },
					x: { type: 'time' },
					marginLeft: 60,
					marks: [
						Plot.lineY(
							data?.map(({ date, value }) => ({
								date: new Date(date),
								value,
							})),

		<P>
			You can observe that the CO2 level develops somehwere in between the closed and the open door
			scenario from the last apartment: Not nearly as bad as the 3500ppm with the door closed, but
			also not as good as the flat 800ppm with the door open.
		</P>
		<P>
			Apart from the smaller volume for the CO2 to disperse into, I also blame the new apartment
			being more modern and thus probably more air-tight than the last one.
