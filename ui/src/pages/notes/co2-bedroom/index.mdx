My recent foray into embedded devices has yielded a nice little CO2 sensor based on the
[Seeed Grove SCD30](http://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-CO2-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-SCD30-p-2911.html). I normally place it in the living room and ingest
all the data into my Grafana / Prometheus based monitoring system. Unfortunately, looking at
some pretty graphs that tell you that you should probably open some windows gets a bit old at
times. So I decided to conduct some experiments with the sensor instead.

<Info>What follows is highly unscientific (n=1). Proceed with caution.</Info>

Most people living with roommates probably have the habit of closing the bedroom door at
night. It's also not uncommon to have someone over at night, making it two people in a closed
room. The same applied for me, only when I moved in with my girlfriend in our own apartment
did we start to leave the bedroom door open at night.

The question arises immediately what happens to the CO2 level in each scenario. First, I
placed the sensor in the bedroom and left the door open:

<div class="my-4">
	<Chart
		options={{
			y: { label: '↑ co2 (ppm)', domain: [0, 1050] },
			x: { type: 'time' },
			marginLeft: 60,
			marks: [
				Plot.lineY(
					dataOpenDoor?.map(({ date, value }) => ({
						date: new Date(date),
						value,
					})),
					{ x: 'date', y: 'value' }
				),
				Plot.ruleY([1000], { stroke: 'orange', strokeDasharray: 2 }),
			],
		}}
	/>
</div>

As the night progresses we can observe a slight rise in CO2 concentration, but the large body
of air in the entire apartment makes sure that the air quality stays in a good range.

Next, I repeated the experiment with the bedroom door closed. Two people, one CO2 sensor, very
romantic:

<div class="my-4">
	<Chart
		options={{
			y: { label: '↑ co2 (ppm)' },
			x: { type: 'time' },
			marginLeft: 60,
			marks: [
				Plot.lineY(
					dataClosedDoor?.map(({ date, value }) => ({
						date: new Date(date),
						value,
					})),
					{ x: 'date', y: 'value' }
				),
				Plot.ruleY([1000], { stroke: 'orange', strokeDasharray: 2 }),
				Plot.ruleY([2000], { stroke: 'red', strokeDasharray: 2 }),
			],
		}}
	/>
</div>

I was shocked to see just how high the CO2 concentration goes in a relatively short period of
time. Interesting is also the sharp decline once we got up and opened the door.

I'm obviously not qualified to make claims about health impacts, but I wouldn't be surprised
if this CO2 level affects sleep quality. For reference, some
[information on the internet](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/chemical/carbondioxide.htm)
suggests that a concentration starting at 2000 ppm is associated with increased heart rate and
headaches.

Needless to say we will leave our door open.
