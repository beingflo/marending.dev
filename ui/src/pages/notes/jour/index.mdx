Years ago I stumbled across a [blog post on lab notebooks](https://sambleckley.com/writing/lab-notebooks.html).
The author argues that practitioners in many fields keep a journal where they
detail what they're up to, what's working and what's not etc. in their daily work.
For some fields such a journal even had legal implications when patents were disputed.
In software engineering however, this is not widespread. At the time I read the post I knew
of no one who kept such notes. 

Sure, we have documentation (maybe), but that's not the same thing. Documentation is there
to explain how a system works, how to interact with it, maybe what constraints it operates
in. But documentation typically doesn't explain _how_ and _why_ we arrived at this particular solution.
Did we try to solve the problem in a different way first but failed, leading to the current
approach? You won't find it that in the documentation. Old attempts either weren't committed
to the code base or squashed away.

This blog post opened my eyes to an issue I had at work I couldn't even put my finger on
before. In my current project at work, I often run into situations where we're reevaluating
a design decision from two years ago because someone thought of a better way to do it.
Inevitably, no one remembers _why_ it was built the way it is. But I would often have this
nagging feeling that we considered the proposed solution back then but decided against it
for _reasons_. Now the big question (possibly worth weeks of effort) is whether we just
didn't think of it back then or whether we're missing the reason now why we didn't do it.
Or, some surrounding factor changed in the meantime, now enabling the better approach.
If I had kept notes on my attempts, failures, assumptions etc. I could simply read up on
this now and we would have clarity. Alas, those notes don't exist.

Naturally, I resolved to start a lab journal. But instead of using my usual 
[notes app](/notes/fieldnotes), I had the feeling I needed something more specialized for
the occasion. An application that would keep entries in a chronological feed, rather than
siloed notes. Enter [jour](https://github.com/beingflo/journal), a simple web app for
keeping journal entries with no hassle. It's local-first with optional S3 sync.
A hosted version is available at [jour.rest.quest](https://jour.rest.quest/).
As you can tell by the URL, this application is another instance of my local-first series
kicked of by [rest.quest](/notes/rest-quest). I would recommend reading that project report
first for the technical details, here I will only go into the feature set and learnings from
this project.
